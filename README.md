Since people liked my production menu enhancement I moved to the next window that is too small in my oppinion, the air deployment menu. Just stretched the menu for resolutions with 1080px and more. 

The Extreme Version also redesigns the slots so even more airwings fit on the screen at once: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=756708652
